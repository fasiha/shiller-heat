  Each of the lines below corresponds to a specific investment horizon (twenty years, fifty years, etc.). Each point on
  a line corresponds to the annualized excess rate of return that an investor would have seen on that date, if they had
  invested a fixed amount every month in the S&P 500 for every month over that horizon, assuming dividends reinvested.
  Breaking this down into more detail, the following chart contains
  <ul>
    <li>real—inflation-adjusted,</li>
    <li>excess returns—beyond the risk-free Treasury rate (specifically, the ten-year Treasury note's annual yield),
    </li>
    <li>of the S&P 500,</li>
    <li>assuming a fixed monthly investment</li>
    <li>over a long time horizon</li>
    <li>with dividends reinvested.</li>
  </ul>
